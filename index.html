      <p>I needed a week to focus on Product developments.</p>
      <p>I've come up with a framework for managing product growth when the product in question is a platform.</p>
      <p>A platform entails multiple product offerings under the same umbrella, say code change management, deployment, and testing.</p>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>Despite different product offerings, <em>uniformity</em> should still be a priority; often easier said than done when you consider the different company departments apart from engineering that need to coordinate on the message being communicated outwardly.</p>
    <p>My solution: Checkerboard Product Management.</p>
    <p>What's Checkerboard Product Management?</p>
    <div class="removeparagraphspace">
      <p>Think of the departments in your company as the columns: a checkerboard is black square, white square, black square, white square, ...</p>
      <p>Think of your product offerings or features as the rows.</p>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <div class="removeparagraphspace">
      <p>Now, together the columns overlay the rows meaning that one department has members responsible for a segment of the feature row, but the department members are ultimately responsible to their department.</p>
      <p>So as a feature gets built, each department is interacting in the feature build as a representative of their department and as a contributor to the specific feature.</p>
      <p>This ensures vision across the platform as a department that lends itself to <em>uniformity</em> across product features.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Take a look:</p>

    <div class="removeparagraphspace">
      <p>So, python and Django. Very interesting to consider the parallel between Django projects and apps and Salesforce sfdx projects and scratch orgs.</p>
      <p>Django is a web framework written with python. Django soups up web development providing pre configured files that become the basis of your web app.</p>
      <p>Salesforce sfdx projects create a file structure that mimics a Dev Hub Salesforce org so that new Salesforce scratch orgs can be created that mimic the structure of your Dev Hub org.</p>

      <p>Snapshot differences are a finicky feature in the <a href="https://copado.com/platform">Copado</a> tool.</p>
      <p>So what to do?</p>
      <p>The idea is to make a comparison between source files of a Salesforce org, git commits, or a combination of those two.</p>
      <p>Can this be done with git tooling or sfdx tools? I'll find out.</p>

    <p>Tuesday, Feb 7. 2023: A stab at destructive changes</p>
    <p>A sub premise to this thread is the value of learning the long way of doing something, because someone else's shortcut might be infested with crocodiles (including my shortcutsâ€“so beware!).</p>
    <p>Last night I was tooling around with destructive changes via the command line.</p>
    <p>Turns out that the <a href="https://copado.com/platform">Copado</a> tool generates a package.xml file in its deployments.</p>
    <p>With that package.xml file, you might be moments away from turning the package.xml file into a destructive change.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Connect your devhub org to your machine. ex., sfdx auth:web:login -d -a {hubalias}</li>
      <li>Connect an org you deployed to to your machine. ex., sfdx auth:web:login -a {sandboxalias} -r {https://test.salesforce.com}</li>
      <li>cd into a folder where you want to create the sfdx project</li>
      <li>Run sfdx force:project:create -n {foldernameforproject}</li>
      <li>Within the new folder you just created, create a new folder called, for example, destructiveFiles</li>
      <li>Paste the package.xml file into destructiveFiles</li>
      <li>Take the contents in the package.xml, copy them, and paste them into a new file called destructiveChanges.xml</li>
      <li>Leave only the xml, package, and version tags in the package.xml file. (Delete everything else)</li>
      <li>Run sfdx force:mdapi:deploy -d ./destructiveFiles -u {usernamefortargetorg}</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Monday, Feb 6. 2023: Initializing the Mattrix</p>
    <p>A Salesforce Development Operations Consultant by trade and by journey, I set out to detail the progressions thus far that have landed me where I am currently.</p>
    <p>I'd like to thank educational resources that have made this telling feasible:</p>
